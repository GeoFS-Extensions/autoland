    <p>
      Thanks for downloading this extension! We worked really hard on this
      extension to make it easy to use, but there's one thing we need you to do!
    </p>
    <p>
      This extension uses a special permission in the chrome world called
      <code>tabs</code>, that allows us to add userscripts directly to GeoFS.
      <br />
      More infomation on how we use this permission can be found
      <a href="">here.</a>
    </p>

    <script src="oninstall.js"></script>
