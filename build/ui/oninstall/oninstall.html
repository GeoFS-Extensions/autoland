      <p>
        Thanks for installing this extension! We worked really hard on this
        extension to make it easy to use, but there's one thing we need you to
        do!
      </p>
      <p>
        This extension uses a special permission in the chrome world called
        <code>tabs</code>, which allows us to add userscripts directly to GeoFS.
      </p>
      <p>
        More infomation on how we use this permission can be found
        <a
          rel="noreferrer"
          href="https://github.com/GeoFS-Autoland/autoland/blob/release/declaration.md#tabs-permission"
          target="_blank"
          >here</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order for this extension to work, we need you to grant us the tabs
        permission. Here's how to do that:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click the button on the bottom of the page.</li>
        <li>A dialog box will pop up that looks like this:</li>
        <img src="../dialog.png" alt="" />
        <li>Click "Allow".</li>
        <li>That's it! The extension is now fully functional!</li>
      </ol>
      <button id="permissionRequestButton">Request</button>
    </div>

      <p>
        To change your preferences, click on the GeoFS icon on the top right of
        your screen.
      </p>
      <img src="top.png" alt="" />
      <p>You will see something like this:</p>
      <img src="emptypopup.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        Click on the button, and play around! We've made the UI intuitive to
        understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open GeoFS, and play around with the popup! You'll see that GeoFS
        updates with your preferences!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you use spoiler arming, remember to use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + your
        spoiler preference (defaults to <kbd>B</kbd>) to arm the spoilers!
      </p>
