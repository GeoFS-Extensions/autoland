      Welcome to GeoFS Plugins!

          <b>Wait!</b> There's just one thing we need you to do for this
          extension to run properly.
        </p>
        <p class="mx-1">
          This extension requires the
          <code class="bg-gray-200 rounded">scripting</code> permission in order
          to inject scripts into GeoFS. Using that permission is a big deal,
          since injecting scripts is one of the riskiest things a chrome
          extension can do.
        </p>
        <p class="mx-1">
          We're commited to security, and the extension you're using right now
          has passed multiple rigorous security reviews. We do that to bring you
          peace of mind in using this extension.
        </p>
        <p class="mx-1">With that in mind, here's how to finish setup:</p>
        <p class="mx-1">Click the button below:</p>
        <button class="m-1 bg-green-200 rounded hover:ring-2 font-sans">
          <p class="p-0.5">Add Permissions</p>
        </button>
        <p class="mx-1">You will see a popup that looks something like this:</p>
        <img
          class="mx-1 border-2 rounded max-w-full"
          src="../../images/permission_popup.png"
          alt="Popup to grant permissions"
        />
        <p class="mx-1">
          Go ahead and click the "Allow" button. That will finish setup, and
          you'll be ready to use all of the extension's features!
        </p>
      </div>
    </article>
    <article class="w-1/2 border-2 rounded float-right mb-2">
      <h2 class="font-bold text-center">Usage</h2>
      <p class="mx-1">
        Now that you're all set up, it's time to get going! Before you get
        started, you can access this page from the settings page, by clicking
        <code class="bg-gray-200 rounded">"View Install page"</code> button.
      </p>
      <!-- TODO: put a demo image here after settings page is done -->
      <p class="mx-1">
        Let's start out by toggling some scripts. First, open
        <a href="https://www.geo-fs.com/geofs.php" target="_blank">GeoFS</a> in
        a new tab. Then, click the icon in the top right of your screen.
      </p>
      <!-- TODO: put a demo image here later -->
      <p class="mx-1">
        Now that the popup is open, let's see what's up.
        <!-- TODO: put more details on the popup here once its done -->
        Take some time and familiarize yourself with the controls here. You'll
        be using them a lot to customize your experience.
      </p>
      <p class="mx-1">
        There's limited space in the popup, so we have to put a lot of other
        settings in a separate page. Let's take a look around the settings page.
        Click the settings icon in the popup.
        <!-- TODO: demo image here -->
        <!-- TODO: put more details on the settings page here once its done -->
      </p>
      <!-- TODO: put a diagram of the popup here -->

      <h2 class="font-bold text-center">Context</h2>
      <p class="mx-1">
        For anyone that doesn't know anything about this extension or GeoFS,
        let's rewind the clock. Keep in mind this is a very brief summary, and
        isn't the full story.
      </p>
      <p class="mx-1">
        Back in 2010, Xavier Tassin released GEFS (Google Earth Flight
        Simulator). In 2016, in light of the termination of the plugin GEFS
        used, GEFS migrated to CesiumJS, an open source virtual globe platform.
        It was then when GEFS becaume GeoFS. This is when its community started
        taking off. Developers started creating plugins for GeoFS. Two major
        players in the field of GeoFS plugins were
        <a href="https://github.com/harryxue1999" class="hover:underline"
          >Harry Xue</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://github.com/Qantas94Heavy" class="hover:underline"
          >Karl Cheng</a
        >. They both created plugins that were later abandoned, AP++ and FMC. In
        summer of 2020, a project emerged, which was at the time called GeoFS
        Autoland. This project eventually evolved into current-day GeoFS
        Plugins. This extension builds on top of the now unmaintained plugins,
        through more detailed control and the addition of new features and
        scripts.
