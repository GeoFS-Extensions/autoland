# Tabs Permission

We use the tabs permission in the chrome extension. This permission can sometimes be used for nefarious purposes, and we've taken extra steps to make sure our codebase is doing exactly what it was intended to do.

**We do not send any information outside of your local machine.**

We've declared this in the Chrome Web Store, and the chrome extension is checked on every release by professionals to make sure it follows the [Developer Program Policies](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program_policies/) and our declarations on the Chrome Web Store.

Along with all of this, we've implemented CI tests to ensure our codebase has no security vulnerabilities.
