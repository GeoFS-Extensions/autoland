Many videos have been made to assist users, so it is suggested that you watch the tutorials at [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCADc2MNvTnNhqyD7iLSy_6g). The tutorials encompass installing autoland, making a autoland FMC route, and using autoland. There is also a document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F4ybxKhG5QYbvifkP2A9epeX30FT6SfWLM5l7KKaSts/edit) that explains how to make an FMC route for autoland.",
