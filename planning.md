# UI Plan

## Popup

- Buttons for main scripts
  - Single default class that's an @apply directive
- Link to settings page for more detailed control

## Settings

- Left side (probably an `<article>`) has tabs for types of settings (e.g. keyboard mapping settings, themes)
- Switches, buttons, and sliders should have a single default classes with @apply directives

## Changelog

- A part of the Settings page
- Dropdown for each update
  - ex. Everything is a link, clicking it unfolds its changelog
- Should be designed from everything opened
  - Folding everything up is second to be done

## Installation

- We need to ask for scripting permissions
  - No outside links
- Also need to explain the extension
