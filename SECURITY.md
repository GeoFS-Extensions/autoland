## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

**How to report a vulnerability**

- Email us at geofsautoland _at_ gmail _dot_ com.
- Explain the vulnerability and how it can be exploited.
- If possible, provide proof of concept code.

We will try and get back to you as soon as possible. We'll inform you of solutions we're implementing, and we'll make sure to credit you in the changelog of the fix. If you wish to remain anonymous, let us know.

Thanks for your contribution!
